# Minkle's Safari Guide to V+: Restoration Druid

Maybe you've seen some guy with a Hamtaro picture with a leaf on his head posting in Druid and other class channels, well instead of reposting my guide every other week for new players its time we have a stable home for people to check back to. Welcome to my Safari Guide to V+

Restoration Druid is my main role here in V+ I was basically the only active resto druid for a large chunk of time and was a cornerstone of our healing core along side Kocherga and Grimple, two very very strong healers from the Horde side who put out absolutely amazing performances with Disc Priest and Elemental Shaman respectively. Not only do I heal a lot but I also tank a lot so I have a fairly nuanced perspective on healing and tanking here and how threat management really works (I manage threat more as a healer than a tank early on).

The bread and butter of Resto druid is Rejuvenation uptime, rank 7 regrowth as the best mana efficiency while still having enough throughput to have an impact with the higher damage intake on v+ and rank 6 then rank 7 Healing touch as you're main two healing ranks.

Getting started as druid, you DO NOT want to prehot you're tanks or you will have mobs running to you and killing you while the tank is trying to position / LOS mobs. You hold off until you're tank has threat and don't heal until you have to. You don't want to just open with rejuv either as it's a GCD and takes 3 seconds for a heal to actually land. Any time someone is at risk of death or needs to be healed right away you need to start with a rank 6 healing touch or rank 7 / 9 regrowth into a rejuvenation first then you either ladder up the healing ranks to make up for you're low casting speed on you're better health per second heals or just spam r6 / r7 as the situation calls for. Because our HT are so slow at higher ranks you will quite frequently ladder up the ranks to deal with more damage to prevent your target from dying going like r6 HT, regrowth, rejuv, r7, r8, r9 for instance. If the damage is very predictable like a Hateful Strike off Rammstein bombing a r9 is usually a better option but those are few and far between.

The main strength of druids is mana sustain and long HOTs for topping up players as damage comes in. You use rejuvenation on you're DPS to top them up and it'll continue to top them as they take more damage during the duration of the HOT allowing you more free GCDs to focus on using you're mana efficient healing touches to keep up the tank. Any time someone is taking more sustained damage you can add in a r7 regrowth especially on tanks to help offset it and keep them topped with r6 healing touch to ensure you have that constant flow of healing incoming and they wont just drop waiting for a max rank healing touch to land. You are very mobile being able to spam rejev while moving or Nature's swiftness or if really required speccing into swiftmend. You have good counters to massive party damage with HOT spam and Tranquility as a strong two minute AOE healing cooldown and make up for your lack of threat management with talented stuns, barkskin, bearform and if really required speccing into threat reduction / tranquil spirit early on if you're with a lowered geared tank.

The bigger the raid group is the more you'll be using Rejuvenation to blanket heal, rejuvenation really starts to shine in LBRS /  UBRS to offset the raid damage and there are some fights like Onyxia, Kazzak and Azurgos where you can almost soley cast Rejuvenation and a little bit of Regrowth for extra sustain or saving someone who is especially low. When raid healing because of that three second tick time, it is often very prudent to open with a regrowth or a few low rank healing touches before letting a rejuvenation top them the rest of the way as just hotting someone to let them die before they even get a health tick is a waste of you're mana and GCDs.

### Let's start with my goto healing spec for Resto Druid:

https://hawaiisa.github.io/vanillaplus-talent-calculator/#/druid/U33J82I9-0-50U13II6I

This is my bread and butter spec, it is the best all situation resto spec. Its great in 5mans, raid healing, filling in on tank healing, it does alright in pvp. There are specs you can do to be more focused but at the expensive of the raw all situational effectiveness this provides. Like yes you can just go max HOTs no Nature's Grace or Catharsis to get a little bit of extra base healing but Nature's Grace and Catharsis have a much boarder use of applications then like 10 extra healing on you're rejuv ticks in that they open you up to having faster tank sustain and being able to effectively turn an almost wipe into a speed pull with you and you're shaman / paladin tank at full mana from an almost wipe OOM emergency or really swing a raid encounter by not only restoring you're mana but also another healers. There have been numerous times where I get brezzed, chain brez another healer, innervate both of us and turn an early disaster pull into a successful kill because of the power of double innervate.

I used to complain, oh dude, look at all these wasted talent points in balance I have to take to get ANYTHING that impacts my healing, this feels like I'm only playing with 30 talent points. I am here to tell you, that is 100% wrong and I've grown to not only really like the early balance talents but find them a vital part to my healing kit and playstyle. Let's start with the balance tree tech:

Mighty Roots is almost as much threat to you're tanks in AOE situations as Seal of Righteousness does for early prot paladins, they're really only hitting in AOE for about 40 damage early on, thorns is hitting for 37. thorns has a bigger impact on AOE threat for shaman tanks than anything in their own kit and eventually when you get swagged out like me you can pick up 2set boomkin to make it even better.

Unity With Nature gives 15% damage reduction from nature and arcane which has its niche encounter uses such as ghouls in scholo, shazz in MC and is a fine bit of bonus survivability but its real power is that it decreases the cooldown of barkskin to two minutes meaning you always have barkskin on the ready for most encounters and it matches conveniently the cooldown of tranquility. Barkskin only increases the casting time of cast spells so in OH SHIT moments with massive party damage, mobs attacking you and general chaos as long as the mobs cannot shield bash you ( ie prison trash in BRD, DO NOT bark skin tranq tank trash in early BRD, you will get silenced) you can HOT everyone up, hit barkskin and have an uninterrupted tranquility go out and top everyone up. I frequently follow this up with a nature's swiftness max rank Healing Touch onto the tank once he's getting low and everyone is topped up enough to survive. 2 minute barkskin lets you healtank using rejuv and spamming rank 6 healing touch on yourself as well as not die / let small adds kill themslves with thorns while you're HOT keeps you up and prevents pushback to say keep healing the tank on Nerub'enkan and other fights with small adds if you're tank mistimes his thunderclap or couldn't pick the adds up in time. Barkskin when combined with bearform can let you eat some crazy hits and re-position mobs saving you're raid as well. Druids are high threat healers so when tanks die in MC, it is quite often that molten destroyer is coming right for you, you can barkskin bearform and run it out of the raid preventing massive damage and saving you're healers and casters from being killed even if you usually die in the process.

Starfall and Hurricane are no brainers, starfall gives you an emergency stun to prevent runners, interrupt spell casts, stun a mob and run back towards the tank so he can pick up an abom or ghoul, stun a mob going from that DPS that overaggroed, save more damage from preventing a mob from using its AOE abilty than even healing would on things like shadow casters, the phase lashers in DM E, retaliating mobs and axe throwers in LBRS. Hurricane is an AOE silence and very effective tool for making large caster packs easy pickings after the tank LOS bunches them up, say stopping the necromancers in UD strath from fearing and forcing them to melee to get the tank extra threat from thorns and other reflect sources of damage as well as preventing the usually higher DPS spells from going out. It is very use, use rank one to prevent over aggroing and talk to you're tank about where to time it. You can also use Hurricane to force a caster mob to walk closer to you're tank if its out of position and you're tank cant pick it up. Hurricane is a real MVP in the first part of UBRS dealing with summoners in the rooms. Hurricane has a large range and can be used to pull mobs that otherwise wouldn't be able to be solo pulled, this is a common trick to pull the one dragon patrol in Ony so we can wall skip and avoid clearing the extra mobs as well as a few pulls in LBRS.

Improved Faerie Fire is some spicy tech for druids, I hate healing 5mans without this ability. Out of any of druids “wasted” talent points I feel this one is a total sleeper and actually incredibly powerful and a large reason why we have such fast and effective clear times in 5mans with the teams I run even without a stacked group of t1 / r14 players. Having a 45 yard instant speed mob tagging ability is VERY strong if you can learn the pulls and is a large part of why druids pair very well with paladin tanks along side super thorns and catharsis to assist with paladins mana issues and paladins having BOP to deal with druids high threat and our own lack of threat drop. Improved Faerie Fire allows you to fast pull the 3 packs of ghouls between pats in UD strath very fast essentially opening up a large corridor to grab the patrols with no fear of chain pulling and can grab the patrols from far away without facepulling the extra gargoyle patrols, it can grab the skeletons in the back left corner of Rattlegore's room in scholomance making you never at risk of pulling the boss or having to fight rattlegore with an add up. Its so long you can easily mob tag for your tank then LOS caster packs right into their conc / tclap or whatever else. Get a good team you run with, embrace being a discount hunter and speed pull mobs into you're tank when you all get good, it is an absolute blast and makes 1 hour UD straths a breeze.

Omnipresence and Power of Nature are not even really filler, having longer range (see improved faerie fire is really good) and hit for your offensive casts hibernates especially is really important and scarce to get on any decent healing gear. Power of Nature is long HOTs, it is a large crux as to why druids are such a powerhouse in healing, eighteen second rejuvs are just strong as it allows you to prehot in anticipation of incoming damage and essentially cheat the GCD by having people already being healed by you're HOTs before the damage even comes in. This is my goto strategy when I know big waves of damage are incoming in 5mans as well as speeding up clear times in MC by making sure people aren't dying to the Surger AOE as I can prehot any low max HP players before the banish breaks so they're instantly getting ticked up by a rejuv and if they're really low HP ie fresh mages and rogues a r7 or r9 regrowth as well. Power of Nature is an absolute monster in raid healing and a large contributor as to why a druid can top healing done and be as much as 1/5 of effective healing done.

Nature's Grace here isn't quite as utilized like it is in the Classic meta of druid where you take Nature's Grace, moonglow and then dip into the Regrowth for the crit bonus. This is largely because we need to uprank more so we cant afford to machine gun rank five regrowths on the raid, the throughput is just too low. But Nature's Grace is still a very strong pickup and allows you to get that little bit of extra throughput needed to keep up tanks and get some clutch uprank r7 fast heals to save people. It has a large impact on offspec healing or if you're the 3rd resto druid in a raid, you can gear more like a boomkin and use crit gear to pump out regrowths quickly to not compete with eachothers HOTs. Offspec boomkins looking for healing advice, this talent is you're bread and butter. If you're not having huge mana issues you can drop the 2 points in moonglow to pickup some regrowth crit but that depends more on raid composition and gear thresholds. The raw sustain and healing power generally gets you further than crit so it's a free pickup for moonkin but generally a main spec healer will want to lean on dreamstate / moonglow for the raw sustain and consistent healing.

Dreamstate and Moonglow... we finally made it, we “wasted” 20 points in balance on spells with no impact to our healing and what do we get as a reward? The best mana regen talent in the game and a substantial discount to all you're relevant spells, not just Healing Touch like deep resto provides. These spells are what make Resto Druids good, you can actually afford to cast regrowth, spam rejuv harder especially with long HOTs and just have amazing mana efficiency and sustain. The choice between some extra healing power and swiftmend is no contest. Swiftmend goes OOM and cannot afford to lean heavily on regrowth. Swiftmend still requires a GCD to use as you need a HOT active to use it then it consumes the HOT so while strong at babysitting tanks, in terms of raw throughput it doesnt actually beat just being able to sustainably spam regrowth and bigger healing touches especially when factoring in Nature's Grace procs. Swiftmend is an excellent tank healing support spec especially for horde and I'd highly recommend a horde raid runs one for that OH SHIT moment instant heal but alliance have Paladins who get Holy Light instant cast stacks who can do that job. We will get into a few specialized variants a little later on.

Swinging over to the Resto talents is a little more straight forward, you need push back reduction, you need shorter casting time on Healing Touch, imp MOTW is you're main buff, you need to rez people, mana regen is a no brainer, improved rejuvenation buffs you're most used source of healing healing, Nature's swiftness is you're emergency button and catharsis makes your dispells a lot more affordable to use as well as gives double innervate, it makes Innervate from a good cooldown into totally tempo swinging. Don't be greedy for a few points in extra healing, take Catharsis and share the love.

#### Specialized Specs

Lets take a minute to post and explain some variants that might be used depending on the situation / raid composition and play style.

##### Threat management spec:

https://hawaiisa.github.io/vanillaplus-talent-calculator/#/druid/U33J82I3-0-50Z11I0A

This is a spec you can use early on if you're tank is having a lot of threat issues and you find yourself tanking the floor more often than being alive. You forgo nature's grace and some of the base healing bonuses but pick up a VERY mana efficient healing touch since you'll be relying a lot less on HOTs if threat really is that big of a concern and an almost free and basically threatless Tranquility to lean on. This is an alternative to just running deep resto early on as it has better mana sustain to actually down fights where deep resto can go OOM even if you save a few people easier with swiftmend it also swiftly runs out of mana and can lead to wipes.

##### Deep resto:

https://hawaiisa.github.io/vanillaplus-talent-calculator/#/druid/0-0-56Z13NIBNV

This is another decent early game spec, make sure to put that point in Furor to give you 10 rage to have a bash when needed. It is very strong in burst healing and tank support in raid, this is the preferred Horde Druid spec on the server. I found myself wiping a lot more often trying run it as it just doesn't have the mana sustain to keep up with the damage here. Its a good support healing spec, does well enough in five mans but deep resto druids tend to overlean on swiftmend and become bad / lazy healers. Its not my fault the tank died, Swiftmend was on cooldown! Swiftmend is always on cooldown because they press it instead of saving it to actually save people from dying. If you are disciplined enough to not just spam you're fun button and go OOM it can do well especially in raid supporting you're other tank healers. The crit bonus on regrowth makes it pretty bursty as well even if very pricey. It is a far more reactive healing build than Moonglow is as you focus on surgical use of swiftmend and hard hitting heals over just prespamming and being proactive. This is not my preferred playstyle but for some, healing without swiftmend is like healing without hands. I prefer being able to afford to cast my spells, but it is a solid choice and almost feels like playing an entirely different class.

##### Long Hots Swiftmend:

https://hawaiisa.github.io/vanillaplus-talent-calculator/#/druid/UF3162-0-50U13IIBH1

A variation on Deep resto that still takes the 18 second rejuvenation, it has its own merits and makes swiftmend a rather mana efficient heal if used at the end of the tick duration. Its a good mix between straight deep resto and moonglow but still struggles from the mana issues of swiftmend and can't go completely ham overcasting. You get the most varied kit out of all druid specs and keep a 2/3 innervate on yourself with catharsis. It is a solid mixed raid / tank healing spec and there is one reason I picked Cycle of life as the filler talent, Animism actually gives a lot of spell damage so with the fast wrath you can actually farm fairly well in this spec and you can play a fun mini game of trying to kill steal for mini innervate procs with Cycle of life. Decent farming spec if you're a fresh druid who wants to play deep resto but needs to be killing mobs for money between 5mans. At the absolute highest gear levels with DMC Blue dragon this might be the best spec for druids if you have enough gear but that level of gearing is not in the game as of yet but t1 resto does seem suited to this style of spec with all of its set bonuses. If you're low on raid healing because no shamans will heal this is a solid raid spec for horde if you need to pull double duty.

##### Resto / Balance pvp & farming variant:

https://hawaiisa.github.io/vanillaplus-talent-calculator/#/druid/VCU18WJ7-0-K0U11N06

Say you really wanna be able to heal but you're also trying to PvP or farm during you're downtime and you dont want to play deep resto. Well this spec is for you. You can also drop the points in Moonkin and Nature's grace if you just want max mana efficiency for healing / farming as you generally don't farm in moonkin and just spam wrath / a low ranked Rejuv to keep yourself topped up. But for pvp the extra burst from Nature's grace and Moonkin form are basically free pickups as dreamstate is generally enough mana sustain on its own. And since we have that point in moonfire crit it is a good opporunity to talk about some fun tech, you can use rank 1 moonfire to fish for Nature's grace procs while you have no need to heal then use it to power out a bigger heal when damage intake happens or if you get a lucky crit off the moonfire when you're stunning you can use that to power out a heal on yourself to keep yourself up if you got chunked. Fun little mana efficient synergy that can be used.

##### Max Hots / World Boss spec:

https://hawaiisa.github.io/vanillaplus-talent-calculator/#/druid/U33J82I3-0-50U03NI6

I dont run this spec often but it's strong on the two world bosses Azurgos and Kazzak. It gives up too much to be used in raid as encounters are changing and the lack of nature's grace and catharsis are usually not worth giving up but as a druid if you're main job is to cat form between frozen targets on Azurgos then just absolutely balls to the walls blanket HOT rejuv spam for kazzak and you're struggling with those bosses, this specialized spec really leans into that roll and gives it the extra edge needed. You can basically fire max regrowth / rejuv on a frozen target then book it over to the next one and the extra healing over time on kazzak can help your raid from not dying to the constant damage intake on kazzak right after as its so important noone dies there.
